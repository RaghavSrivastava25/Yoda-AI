## Introduction

Yoda AI is a Python-based project that showcases the potential of Language Learning Models (LLMs) for building intelligent applications. By utilizing LLMs such as GPT-4, Llama, OpenAI, and Hugging Face models, coupled with vector databases like Chroma and FAISS, Yoda AI empowers developers to create a wide range of applications that span from advanced document-based conversations to dynamic web searches and interactive GPT chatbots.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Conversations with Documents:** Yoda AI enables users to interact with documents using natural language queries. It leverages LLMs to comprehend context and deliver meaningful responses.

- **Web Search and Data Extraction:** With the ability to perform web searches and extract information from search results, Yoda AI offers a dynamic approach to answering questions.

- **Interactive GPT-Based Chatbots:** The project provides a foundation for creating chatbots that employ LLMs to engage in conversations with users, delivering contextually relevant responses.

- **Modular Architecture:** Yoda AI is designed with modularity in mind. Developers can easily switch between different LLMs, vector databases, and tools to suit specific application requirements.
